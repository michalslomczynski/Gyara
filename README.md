Gyara is a script and library that lexes and parses a file consisting of one more YARA rules into a Golang struct type representation. The goal of this tool is to import and parse the contents of multiple YARA rules directly within Go code.

```bash
go run main.go <rule_file>
```
or call imported ParseRule in your codebase
